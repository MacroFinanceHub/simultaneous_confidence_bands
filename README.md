# Computing Simultaneous Confidence Bands in Stata

Simultaneous confidence bands are versatile tools for visualizing estimation uncertainty for parameter vectors ([Montiel Olea and Plagborg-Møller 2018](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mikkelpm/files/conf_band.pdf)). 

This repo houses a Stata function that computes the critical values underlying the simultaneous sup-t confidence bands proposed in [Montiel Olea and Plagborg-Møller (2018)](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mikkelpm/files/conf_band.pdf). 

## Installation 

## Unit Tests

The repo houses to sets of unit tests. The first set asserts basic functionality. The second set asserts expected coverage rates for a given data generating process. 

Both sets of unit tests can be executed by running the make.py script.
